# Description

The Palindrome Checker is a web-based application that allows users to input a string and determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. This project demonstrates basic web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Interactive User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for entering strings.
- Real-time Checking: Instant feedback on whether the input string is a palindrome.
- Case Insensitivity: Treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.
- Punctuation and Space Ignorance: Ignores non-alphanumeric characters for accurate checking.
